Usage
Run the Application: Execute the script to launch the Weather App.
Select a City: Use the dropdown menu to select a city from the list.
Fetch Weather Data: Click the "Done" button to retrieve and display the weather information for the selected city.
Code Explanation
Imports: The application imports necessary modules from Tkinter and the Requests library.
Function data_get(): This function is called when the "Done" button is clicked. It retrieves the selected city name, makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, and updates the labels with the weather data.
GUI Layout: The application window is configured with labels, a combobox for city selection, and a button to fetch the weather data.
API Key
The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API, which requires an API key. Replace the placeholder API key in the code with your own key to fetch weather data.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter an "Invalid API key" error, ensure that you have replaced the API key in the code with a valid one from OpenWeatherMap.
